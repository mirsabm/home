		<p> A radial curve is the most extreme type of curve on a longboard, it provides extra leverage for more contol and easier turning by making the board more responsive </p>
		<h4> Advantages </h4>
		<p> Great for carving, free-style, and even downhill </p>
		<h4> Disadvantages </h4>
		<p> Uncomfortable underneath the feet and not the best to lock your feet in for high speeds </p>

		<p> This type of curve is rare to see on longboards but is usually seen on cruisers, it's the opposite of a radial curve because they curve down instead od up to provide maximum comfort as it mimics the arch of the foot </P>
		<h4> Advantages </h4>
		<p> Comfortable underneath the feet </p>
		<h4> Disadvantages </h4>
		<p> Very little to no control </p>

		<p> A w-concave board is designed in a W shape with edges curving up from the sides and a bump in the middle, these boards are great for locking in your feet for speed and slides </p>
		<h4> Advantages </h4>
		<p> Excellent for downhill and free-style </p>
		<h4> Disadvantages </h4>
		<p> May get uncomfortable to ride after a while </p>
