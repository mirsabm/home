		<p> Inspired from surfboards, this iconic shape has distinctive front and back which indicate the direction it's meant to be ridden in </p>
		<h4> Advantages </h4>
		<p> Best for cruising and light carving </p>
		<h4> Disadvantages </h4>
		<p> Have little to no concave so not the best for control </p>

		<img src = "MiniCruiser.jpeg" width = "400" height = "300" alt = "Picture of a small longboard with a pointed tip, red wheels, and black grip tape patterns on a cement floor" />
		<p> Mini Cruisers come in all sort of shapes and profiles and come in smaller size. Thus having a smaller wheel base (distance between the front and back wheels.) This make them ideal for light carving and cruising </p>
		<h4> Advantages </h4>
		<p> Great for turning, cruising, and overall easy to carry. </p>
		<h4> Disadvantages </h4>
		<p> Become very unstable at high speeds </p>
		<h3 id = "CutOut"> Cut Out </h3>
		<img src = "CutOut.jpeg" width = "600" height = "300" alt = "Picture of a wood cutout longboard on a white background" />
		<p> Cut out decks are still pretty modern and have cutouts above the wheels for added clearence and are extremely versatile </p>
		<h4> Advantages </h4>
		<p> BCan be used for carving, downhill,cruising, and even free-style </p>
		<h4> Disadvantages </h4>
		<p> Since this shape is the "jack-of-all-trades," it doesn't excell at things that have boards made specifically for them such as downhill riding. </p>
